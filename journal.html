	<h1>Journal:</h1> 
	<h2> Entry 9/26/24:<h2>
		<p>This is the first journal entry of my website. So far we've learned about divs, moving them around, colors, scrolling, text, and fonts. I have some visions about what my website could look like. I was imagining a sort of piano thing in my projects. I don't really know yet. I'm still working on thhe home page, and I still need to finish all of the links on the home page. I need some images on my website, but I'll get those later. I still don't have a real theme for my website yet, but it's still early on. </p>
